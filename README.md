NOTE : Please read the whole doc to understand how to use this piece of code efficiently.  

[RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap) is an advanced physical memory usage analysis utility for Windows 10.  
It presents usage information in different ways on its several different tabs.  
It is one of the best ram monitoring tools. 


## How to use This
To download the file, go to the [releases](https://github.com/Shadowblazer93/RamMAP-Shortcut/releases) and download the source code.                 
Whenever you feel like clearing you ram, just run the .bat file and you will feel your computer getting more responsive.  

## Activate the .bat file from anywhere
To activate the file from a keyboard shortcut, first [create a shortcut of the .bat file](https://www.howtogeek.com/436615/how-to-create-desktop-shortcuts-on-windows-10-the-easy-way/)  
You can then [assign a keyboard shortcut](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/open-programs-with-keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-10/) to open the file from anywhere  
NOTE : Do not spam the shortcut as this will greatly impact your disk and may lessen the life of it.

Whenever you want to clear ram, you have to open the software and empty the sets induvidually.  
With this .bat file, you can clear gigs of ram in an instant.  

RamMap has special command lines for emptying each set.
